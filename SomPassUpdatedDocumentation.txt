This document outlines the conceptualization, analysis, and development plan for a web3-based decentralized event management platform inspired by Luma (lu.ma). The goal is to replicate and enhance Luma's core functionalities while integrating web3 elements such as decentralized storage via IPFS and blockchain operations on the Somnia testnet. Additional AI features will be incorporated using the Google Gemini API to improve user experience, such as AI-assisted event discovery and content generation. The design and usability will mirror Luma's intuitive, aesthetically pleasing interface to ensure familiarity and high adoption rates.
The project, tentatively named "SomPas" (or a similar branding), aims to empower users with ownership over event data, enable tokenized ticketing (e.g., via NFTs), and foster community-driven events in a censorship-resistant manner. By leveraging Somnia's high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, the platform will handle real-time interactions at scale, supporting over 1,000,000 transactions per second (TPS) with sub-second finality.

Section 1: Analysis of Luma
Luma is a user-friendly, no-code event management platform designed for creating, hosting, and managing events ranging from virtual Zoom meetups to in-person gatherings. It emphasizes simplicity, aesthetics, and community engagement, making it popular among creators, businesses, and communities.
1.1 Key Features
Based on comprehensive research, Luma's features include:

Event Creation and Customization: Users can quickly set up event pages with customizable templates, including titles, descriptions, dates, locations (virtual or physical), and multimedia elements like images or videos. No coding is required, with drag-and-drop interfaces for adding details.
Invitation and RSVP Management: Easy invite sending via email, links, or social sharing. RSVPs are tracked in real-time, with options for guest lists, waitlists, and reminders. QR code check-ins for in-person events streamline attendance.
Ticketing and Monetization: Supports free and paid events with built-in ticketing. Users can set prices, offer multiple ticket types (e.g., early bird, VIP), and integrate payment gateways like Stripe for low-fee transactions (typically lower than competitors like Eventbrite).
Integrations: Seamless with Zoom for virtual events, calendars (Google, Apple), and tools like Stripe for payments. It also supports embedding event pages on websites.
Discovery and Marketing Tools: A public discovery feed allows users to browse upcoming events. Marketing features include customizable banners, SEO-optimized pages, and analytics for attendance rates and engagement.
Attendee Experience: Chat features for pre-event discussions, personalized calendars for RSVPed events, and post-event feedback collection.
Community Building: Tools for recurring events, member-only access, and group management, ideal for clubs or ongoing series.
Analytics and Tracking: Dashboards for organizers to monitor RSVPs, attendance, and revenue. Features like attendee tracking help measure ROI.

Luma supports both one-off and recurring events, with options for members-only Zoom events where access is gated.
1.2 Unique Selling Points (USPs)

Ease of Use and No-Code Design: Luma stands out for its intuitive interface, allowing non-technical users to create professional-looking event pages in minutes, outperforming clunky alternatives like Google Forms or Eventbrite.
Aesthetic Appeal: Beautiful, modern templates ensure events look premium without design expertise.
Low-Cost Model: Free for basic events, with low fees on paid tickets (e.g., competitive with or better than Eventbrite), leading to higher attendance and ROI.
Community and Discovery Focus: Built-in social features like chats and discovery feeds encourage organic growth, unlike siloed platforms.
Versatility: Handles virtual, hybrid, and in-person events seamlessly, with strong Zoom integration for remote communities.
User Growth and Adoption: Praised for robust analytics and marketing tools, helping organizers scale events effectively.

Reviews highlight its superiority for small to medium events, with users noting higher attendance rates due to engaging pages.
1.3 Architecture
Public information on Luma's architecture is limited, as it's a proprietary SaaS platform. Inferred from features and reviews:

Frontend: Built with modern web technologies (likely React or similar JS frameworks) for responsive, mobile-friendly interfaces. Emphasizes clean UI/UX with fast loading times.
Backend: Cloud-based (possibly AWS or Google Cloud) with databases for user data, events, and RSVPs. Real-time features suggest WebSockets or similar for updates (e.g., live RSVP counts).
Storage: Centralized servers for images/videos, with CDN for distribution.
Scalability: Handles thousands of users per event, with integrations via APIs (e.g., Zoom API, Stripe API).
Security: Standard web security, including HTTPS, user authentication, and data privacy compliance (e.g., GDPR).

No explicit AI features are mentioned in Luma, but its discovery could involve basic algorithms.
1.4 Design and Usability
Luma's design is minimalist and elegant, with a focus on visual appeal:

UI Elements: Clean layouts with high-quality images, sans-serif fonts (e.g., similar to Inter or Helvetica), subtle animations, and color schemes that adapt to event themes.
Usability: Step-by-step wizards for event creation, intuitive navigation (e.g., dashboard for organizers, calendar views for attendees). Mobile responsiveness ensures seamless use on phones.
Accessibility: High contrast, keyboard navigation, and alt text for images.

To replicate: Use Figma or similar for wireframes mirroring Luma's pages, ensuring 1:1 parity in flow (e.g., event setup in under 5 steps).
Section 2: Web3 Adaptation - SomPass on Somnia
2.1 Overview
SomPass will decentralize Luma by storing event data (images, descriptions) on IPFS for immutability and censorship resistance. Core operations (e.g., RSVPs, ticketing) will occur on Somnia blockchain via smart contracts, enabling tokenized tickets as NFTs, decentralized governance, and crypto payments.

Web3 Benefits: User-owned data, transparent transactions, reduced fees via crypto, and community incentives (e.g., tokens for hosting events).

2.2 Key Integrations

IPFS Storage: Use web3.storage or Infura IPFS nodes to upload files. Generate Content Identifiers (CIDs) and store them in Somnia smart contracts. For example, event images uploaded via frontend -> IPFS -> CID saved on-chain.
Somnia Blockchain: EVM-compatible L1 with 1M+ TPS. Deploy smart contracts for event creation (e.g., ERC-721 for NFT tickets), RSVPs (on-chain commitments), and payments (native token or stablecoins). Use testnet (Shannon) for development, with RPC endpoints for interactions.
Wallet Integration: Use Reown (formerly WalletConnect) or MetaMask for user authentication and transactions on Somnia.

2.3 AI Features with Gemini API
Integrate Google Gemini API for multimodal AI capabilities:

AI Queries for Relevant Events: Users input natural language queries (e.g., "tech meetups in NYC"); Gemini processes to suggest events via semantic search on on-chain/IPFS data.
AI Assistance for Event Descriptions: Auto-generate or enhance descriptions, titles, or agendas based on user prompts (e.g., "Suggest a fun description for a blockchain hackathon").
Additional AI: AI-powered recommendations, chatbots for attendee queries, or sentiment analysis on feedback.

Implementation: Use Gemini's text generation endpoints (e.g., generateContent) via SDKs. Handle API keys securely in backend.
